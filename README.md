# list-curator
A data curation framework that could be used to instantiate applications with a combination of these components in a reactive environment:

* Rich and dynamic faceted search [Filterer](https://observablehq.com/@kasivisu4/recursive_data_filter?collection=@kasivisu4/list_curator). Been able to go back and fort between exploration and filters.
* Effective Annotations [Annotator](https://observablehq.com/@kasivisu4/annotator?collection=@kasivisu4/list_curator). Either free form, or adding new categories and attributes.
* Progress tracking over different sessions. Pickup from where you left, keep track of which elements you have seen.
* Rich sorting [Sorter](https://observablehq.com/d/c05004227c24ac13?collection=@kasivisu4/list_curator)
* Detailed and summarized visualizations of the data [Faceted search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search)
* Apply a label to the results of the filter
